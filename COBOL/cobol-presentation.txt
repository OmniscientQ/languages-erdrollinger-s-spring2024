"Common Business-Oriented Language"
COBOL first specified in 1959 by Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL)
Revised as recently as 2002

English-Like Syntax
Excels at processing lots of data, file handling - finance and inventory.
Portable, which was a novel thing way back when.
Decades of proven real-world reliability

Main Segments of a COBOL Program
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
DATA DIVISION.
PROCEDURE DIVISION.

Example:
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. HELLO-WORLD.

PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    DISPLAY 'Hello, World!'.
    STOP RUN.

Attempted Hello World! was more complicated than expected!
Unique formatting requirements, with reserved character columns

Columns 1 to 6: Sequence numbers - Ignored by compiler, but useful for automated punch card sorting.

Column 7: Indicator.
	' ' declares a line to regular code
	'D' indicates a debug line that is ignored unless compiler is given debug flag
	'*' is a comment line
	'/' is a comment that also forces a page eject from the printer output of the compiling machines
	'-' is a continuation of the previous line, usually only needed for explicitly defined strings.

Columns 8 to 11: Division, section, and paragraph headers must begin within this area

Columns 12 to 72: Regular old code lines

Columns 73 to 80: Program name. Again, ignored by the compiler, but useful for automated sorting of cards from multiple programs.
